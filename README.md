### Howdy! 👋🏼

I'm currently a senior studying Computer Science at the University of Kentucky as well as an Application Developer at UPS. At the moment, I'm learning to utilize SwiftUI and working in Java. For the following several months, I'll be working on iOS projects as well as a blockchain POC for an industry customer.

Aside from work and school, I'm into music! I play bass guitar and piano and have experimented with a few musical groups over the years.



Thanks for stopping by! Take care of yourself!
